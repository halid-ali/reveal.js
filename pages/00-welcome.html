    <p>Let's start!</p>
    <p>
      In today's tech-talk, I will try to give you a quick overview about the Antora which is a site generator for tech

      I prepared for you a 12-slides presentation to touch bullet points of the tool. I will try to keep the
      presentation session as short as possible. Because I have prepared a demo in order to show the Antora in action.
