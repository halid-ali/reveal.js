    <p>Partials are good for storing snippets of content that you reuse in one or more pages throughout your site.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Partial files are stored in a partials directory.</li>
      <li>
        A partial’s filename can’t contain spaces because the AsciiDoc include directive doesn’t accept values with
        spaces.
      </li>
      <li>A partial must be referenced by an include directive from a page.</li>
      <li>Antora doesn’t publish partial files as individual site pages.</li>
